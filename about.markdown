Hi, I'm Johannes Vogt, a software developer and machine learning enthusiast.


Starting with self-taught Visual Basic and C++ in 2005, today I'm focussed on creating web apps and cloud services in JavaScript, training machine learning models in Python and writing a considerable amount of Bash for all the automation.

Some highlights include:
- a fluid simulation in Python (2008)
- balancing an inverse pendulum using a ball mouse (2011)
- designing the challenges for the LEGO Mindstorm competion and leading it as judge during the University of Heidelberg's "Lange Nacht der Robotik" (2012 & 2013)

Since 2016 I've been working at [SAP](https://sap.com/), developing innovative technologies like indoor navigation and core cloud services. I like to keep the big picture in mind and dive deep into complex topics together with my colleagues.
